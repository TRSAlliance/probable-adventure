# TRS Signal Sandbox

> Experimental space for simulating TRS signal drift, Sentinel boundary enforcement, and trust state volatility.

### Modules Included:
- `ghostDrift.js`: Mutates signal trust values to simulate ethical ambiguity or situational flux.
- `simulator.js`: Mimics TRS-15 Sentinel reaction to signal anomalies.
- `mockSignals.json`: Test input for simulation scenarios.

> Do not use for production â€“ this is an exploration layer.
